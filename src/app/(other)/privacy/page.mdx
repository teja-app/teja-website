- **Third-Party Analytics**: To enhance user experience, some data is obtained via third-party analytics services. Cookies may be used solely for analytical purposes and not for marketing or advertising.
- **Error Reporting**: In the event of app errors, we collect log data through third-party products. This may include your IP address, device name, operating system version, and app configuration at the time of the error, along with other relevant statistics.


**Apple HealthKit and Google Fit Integration**

Teja.app offers an integration feature with Apple HealthKit and Google Fit, ensuring an enriched, personalized experience for our users. Here's how we handle this integration:

2. **Privacy and Data Management**:
   - Information from HealthKit or Google Fit is not used for marketing, advertising, or data mining, including by third parties.
